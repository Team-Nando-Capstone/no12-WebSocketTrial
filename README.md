** This project is still working. **
** There may be some code from open-source projects, all these sources will be posted in README later or at the end of the project. **

** If you find your code is illegally used in this project, we apologize for it, you can connect us, we will delete the related code and make apologies as soon as possible! **

For running this project by using index.html, you need firstly ensure the python 2.7 to 3.6 installed in your computer, because Websocket's code can not be recognizd by python 3.7 and 3.8 at present. Our suggestion is install both version of python on your computer and use 'python2.exe' as environment to run the code in file.

Additionally, after following the instruction of Websocket, you need to run the standalone server with port #9998, otherwise, the data transmission will be blocked.

For the detailed tutorial instruction, you can check this website:
